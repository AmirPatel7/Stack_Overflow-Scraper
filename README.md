# Stack_Overflow-Scraper
A python program that uses Flask to accept URL parameters as endpoints, and then uses those URL parameters to scrape stackoverflow for the information on the requested parameter in the URL. More information about how this works and the possible endpoints that are supported are commented in the code.
